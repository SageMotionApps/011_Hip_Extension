**Note: Before you install an app that uses this template (for example, to edit the app on the hub), you should change the following things in the info.json file:**

- app_name
- app_version
- app_id
- version_id

All other things can be changed after the app is installed if editing code on the hub. Editing these after moving the app to the hub might cause problems.
